# RMV - the cli file removal tool (but with a progress bar)

Are you, like me tired of doing `rm -rf node_modules` and waiting an eternity with no feedback?
And do you also hate flooding the terminal with `rm -rfv node_modules`?

Well then `rmv` is the tool for you!

Simply install the binary into your `/usr/local/bin/rmv` and away you go!

## Usage

`rmv <path>` to delete the path. Then watch some magic happen.
